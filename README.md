# mag2grids
An attempt to use the saga_api to gracefully create grids for UXO assessment.
Takes a series of shape files created from a G882 Caesium Vapor Marine Magnetometer array that have been pre-processed to include attributes for reduced total field and the analytic field.  Produces grids based on the input shapes using https://github.com/saga-gis/saga-gis tools and API.
